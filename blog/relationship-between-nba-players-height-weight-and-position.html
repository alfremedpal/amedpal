            Modern basketball has 5 player positions: <b>point guard</b> (PG), <b>shooting guard</b> (SG), <b>small forward</b> 
            (SF), <b>power forward</b> (PF), and <b>center</b> (C). Each position requires a different set of skills, as they
            they have different responsabilities on the court. Height and weight can also help excel at certain postitons. 
            For example, centers (the tallest and heaviest of the team) usually play near the baseline or close to the 
            basket.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph container">
            I decided to visualize this relationship between height and weight, and the basketball position among NBA players.
            Once gathered all the information, build a model that could take custom height and weight parameters in 
            order to predict or determine into which position the body measurements fit best.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="title">Data</h3>
        <p class="paragraph container">
            <b>basketball-reference.com</b> (BR) is a great website for everything basketball related and the perfect source 
            for all the information I needed. BR has a player directory which include all NBA and ABA players from all 
            time indexed by letter with their respective position, height, and weight. There is just one problem. If you visit
            a player's page on BR it will tell you their specific position or role such as PG or SF, but in the players by letter
            index the positions are the "old" or "original" positions which are just 3: <b>guard</b>, <b>forward</b> and,
            <b>center</b>.  
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph container">
            As much as I would have loved to use the 5 modern positions, scraping each individual player's page was far more 
            complex and time consuming than gathering the data from the players by letter pages. Fun fact, there are no players
            (last name) with the letter 'X'. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph container">
            I used <b>BeautifulSoup 4</b> and some of the source code of 
            <a href="https://github.com/alfremedpal/PandasBasketball">PandasBasketball</a> to scrape the data off BR. 
            But there was another problem: some players can play up to 2 roles, making the positions: G, F, C, F-G, G-F,
            F-C, and C-F for a total of 7 positions. So I had to clean this up by renaming the duplicates like G-F and F-G.
            I finally ended up with only 5 positions, or set of positions: 
            
            
            <ul class="list" style="color: black;">
                <li><b>G</b> - Guard</li>
                <li><b>F</b> - Forward</li>
                <li><b>C</b> - Center</li>
                <li><b>G-F</b> - Guard-Forward</li>
                <li><b>F-C</b> - Forward-Center</li>
            </ul>

            Plotting all players' height (y) and weight (x) grouped by their position resulted in this image:

            This is somewhat useful, but the plot felt a little bit too cramped and some of the colors like the 
            blue with the purple and the red with the orange were not as distinguishable as I would have liked. 
            So, I decided to plot some pair plots splitting positions into groups. In seaborn, the <b>pair plot 
            function</b> will create a grid of Axes such that each variable in the data will be shared in the 
            y-axis across a single row and in the x-axis across a single column. The diagonal Axes are treated 
            differently, drawing a plot to show the univariate distribution of the data for the variable in that 
            column.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph container">
            The pair plot with all 5 positions is practically the same: too many points overlapping each other
            making it difficult to appreciate each group.

            But using a group containing only the G, F, and C postitions and another group with G-F and F-C, helped 
            (at least to me) to better visualize how are positions spread depending on the height and the weight.

            Any basketball fan will tell you that the visualization does not provide any significal new information.
            We already knew that <b>guards are shorter and lighter</b>, making them perfect for dribbling, that 
            <b>centers are the tallest and heaviest</b> to help protect the rim, and that <b>forwards are versatile</b>
            being in between.

            The G-F and F-C group was trivial as well, both spanning their corresponding individual positions along

        <p class="paragraph container">
            The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. 
            Given a new sample (like the green dot), the algorithm will take the sample's k nearest neighbors (red 
            triangles and blue square) by measuring the distance. After that, the algorithm will 
            assign the green dot to either the triangle or the square category depending on which was more dominant 
            among the neighbors. In this example, since 2 of the 3 neighbors of the green dot are red triangles, the new
            sample would be assigned to this category.

            To test how accurate my model was, I used a <b>confusion matrix</b>. A confusion matrix is a specific table layout 
            that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a 
            predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class (or vice versa).

            The matrix shows that the model has no major problem distinguishing between single positions among each other 
            (G, F, C), but it is a little bit harder for the two-role positions (G-F, F-C). It is far from perfect but 
            it will work just fine for some educated guessing or prediction.

            We can clearly see that the areas for the G, F, and C positions are pretty well defined, while the G-F
            and F-C position areas are just patched around the middle.

            Finally I wrote a small function that takes any height (m) and weight (kg) to predict to which position is the 
            person better suited for. I used my own height and weight and got the following results:

        <p class="paragraph container">
            I learned a lot doing this analysis, particularly the KNN classification method and its visualization. Although I 
            know it is not perfect and there could be a couple of things I could tweak to maybe make it a little bit better,
            I'm really happy with the result.
