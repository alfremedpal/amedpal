            This was one of my first encounters and first project involving spatial data and geopandas. I made a 
            small <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b0navl/where_do_american_nba_players_come_from_oc/">reddit post</a> 
            about it. If you want more information and some Q&A's I suggest you give the post a look.
        </p>
    
        <p class="paragraph container">
            This is not intended to be a tutorial but a kind-of-vague explanation on how I did it. You can check out my
            <a href="https://github.com/alfremedpal">github</a> or this project's 
            <a href="https://github.com/alfremedpal/amedpal-blog/tree/master/where-do-nba-players-come-from">repository</a>

        </p>     
    
        <p class="paragraph container">
            I decided to split this project into three areas: <b>reading</b>, <b>preparing</b>, and <b>visualizing</b> the data. 
            The following blocks of code are extracts from my complete notebook which can be found 
            <a href="https://github.com/alfremedpal/amedpal-blog/tree/master/where-do-nba-players-come-from">here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="title">Reading the data</h3>
        <p class="paragraph container">
            First things first, getting the data. <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth Data</a> 
            is a great source of geospatial information in the form of <b>.shp files</b>; in this case I downloaded 
            the states and provinces dataset in a 1:10 scale. After downloaded, the files need to be read and, since
            this dataset contains information from all countries around the world, I had to select only the states
            which belong to the U.S.A.  
        </p>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">

        states = gpd.read_file("ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces.shp")
        usa_states = states[states["admin"] == "United States of America"]
        players_usa_states = pd.read_csv("players_usa_states.csv")
        </pre>
 
        
        <p class="paragraph container">
            The last line of the previous block of code is just an extra .csv file I put together with the information on how many
            players each American state has ever produced, and the population for that particular state.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="title">Preparing the data</h3>
        <p class="paragraph container">
            Although we now have all the information in normal dataframes and <b>geodataframes</b>, we still need to make some 
            adjustments to the data. I started with the basic like keeping only the useful columns, changing the 
            <b>Coordinate Reference System</b> (CRS), and sorting by state name.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">

        usa_states = usa_states[["state", "geometry"]]
        usa_states = usa_states.to_crs(epsg=3395)
        usa_states.sort_values("state", inplace=True)
        </pre>
    
        <p class="paragraph container">
            The bext step was to merge both frames, but before doing that I had to make sure their shapes matched. 
            After merging we can peek on how the final frame is looking with <b>.head(3)</b>.   
        </p>
    
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">

        print(usa_states.shape)
        print(players_usa_states.shape)
        usa_states = pd.merge(usa_states, players_usa_states, on="state")

        usa_states.head(3)

        <h3 class="title">Visualizing the data</h3>
        <p class="paragraph container">
            Now comes the fun part: visualizing! The argument <i>'column'</i> takes the values from the specified column 
            name and it will then use those values to paint the choropleth map. The <i>.set</i> method simply sets the range
            of coordinates to be rendered. In this case we are focusing on the United States and, to keep things
            simpler and cleaner, I decided not to include Alaska or Hawaii.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">

        fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))
        usa_states.plot(ax=ax, column="player_count", cmap="YlGn", edgecolor="k", legend=True)
        ax.set_title("Number of NBA players by state of origin")
        ax.set_axis_off()
        ax.set(xlim=(-1.4*10**7, -0.74*10**7), ylim=(0.2750*10**7, 0.65*10**7))

        </div>

        <p class="paragraph container">
            It looks good but eh... it doesn't tell you much. You can see that states with large amounts of NBA players 
            are also the ones with big populations (like California and New York). Therefore this is bascially just a population map and 
            not very interesting (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1138/">relevant xkcd</a>).
        </p>
    
        <p class="paragraph container">
            To "fix" this I decided to plot maps with the number of NBA players by state of origin per 10,000 population, and per
            10k population living in urban areas. In order to achive this though, I had to add some new columns to the dataframe.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">

        usa_states["per_10k"] = (usa_states["player_count"] / usa_states["pop"]) * 10000
        usa_states["urban_pop"] = usa_states["pop"] * (usa_states["urban%"] / 100)
        usa_states["per_10k_urban"] = (usa_states["player_count"] / usa_states["urban_pop"]) * 10000
        </pre>
    
        <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center">
            <img src="images/nba_by_state_10k.png" class="img-thumbnail img-spacer" alt="NBAByState10K">
            <img src="images/nba_by_state_10k_urban.png" class="img-thumbnail img-spacer" alt="NBAByState10KUrban">
        </div>
    
        <p class="paragraph container">
            Now this is more useful!  
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="title">Conclusion and final notes</h3>
        <p class="paragraph container">
            We can see that California is the biggest porfessional player generator with 395, followed by New York with 356, 
            but as stated before, this is not a big surprise since their population is quite big. The state with more players 
            per 10,000 population is District of Columbia with just a bit over 1 player. The second and third states are Mississippi 
            and Louisiana with 0.29 and 0.25 players per 10,000 respectively. The big difference between the per 10k
            values of the first and second states was the reason I decided to explicitly set the max value of the color bar,
            otherwise the map would have looked mostly white. Alaska and Hawaii have produced 1 and 2 professional basketball 
            players respectively.
        </p>
    
        <p class="paragraph container">
            <b>Also, if you are wondering why Michigan looks funny</b>, it is because it was plotted with its legal boundry which 
            includes a lot of water.
        </p>
    
        <p class="paragraph container">
            This was a small, fun project which helped me understand better spatial data and its manipulation and visualization using 
            Python. I'm happy on how it turned out and I may explore some vartions like how many points (or blocks, rebounds, etc.) 
            each state has yielded. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph container">
            The information on the actual number of NBA players by state is according to 
            <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">basketball-reference</a>. The population 
            numbers are according to wikipedia. You can find the complete notebook
