        <p class="paragraph container">
            Last week I finally decided to migrate my personal website from <a href="#">pythonanywhere</a> to
            an AWS S3 bucket. It is a change I've been wanting to make for a long time but for some reason I could
            never find time to do it. In this little blog post I'll be sharing what I learnt in the process.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Transferring the domain name to Route53</h2>
        <p class="paragraph container">
            I figured that if I was moving to AWS then I might go all the way and move my domain name ownership as well.
            The offcial Route53 docs were a little heavy on the reading side for me, but still useful. I still managed 
            to screw up though, and I ended going offline for about 10 days: the amount of time my old registrar (namecheap)
            took to transfer the domain. 
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph container">
            I had never transferred any domain names to Route53 or any other registrar for that matter, so it was kind of scary
            at first due to all the e-mail confirmations and codes; they take all this domain ownership very seriously,
            and I'm glad they do.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Creating the S3 bucket</h2>
        <p class="paragraph container">
            I was impressed by how easy this was, plus, the 
            <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">
                small tutorial/doc
            </a> 
            AWS offers is beyond useful, clear, simple, and straight to the point. It was such a fun experience and I 
            really enjoyed the whole process.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph container">
            Now, I'll be listing some pros and cons (from my point of view) of migrating to a static website using S3.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title">Pros</h3>
        <div class="paragraph container">
            <ul>
                <li>Cheaper</li>
                <ul>
					<li>
						I used to pay $5/month with pythonanywhere (a great deal for what I was getting), but now I pay $0.50
						a month for the Route53 hosting zone and I think that's it because I'm still inside the 12 months of the
						S3 free tier. With what I'm saving I might even set up an email with WorkMail.
					</li>
                </ul>
				<li>Flexible editing</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I'm working with the .html files directly now, no WYSIWYG editor or anything, so I kinda have more
						control over what I can do since I operate on the .html and .css files directly.
					</li>
                </ul>
				<li>Lighter</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Since I'm serving the files directly it loads a little bit faster, and the overral sinze of the files
						is minimal.
					</li>
                </ul>
				<li>Serverless</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I don't need to manage servers, patches, updates, or anything of the sorts. If I want to update a file
						I literallt just drag and drop the new version.
					</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="title">Cons</h3>
        <div class="paragraph container">
            <ul>
                <li>Tedious</li>
                <ul>
					<li>
						Sometimes it can be a bit tiring to be working on an IDE directly with the files instead of a web editor 
						like summernote or froala.
					</li>
                </ul>
				<li>No server-side scripting</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Since it is a static wbesite it works better to <i>show</i> things than to <i>do</i> things. I can't have
						a dynamically generated graph or stuff like that.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Repetitiveness</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All my files have the same header, footer, and meta files; I can't use a template like in Flask + Jinja
						to just write the content and keep everything cleaner.
					</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="title">Final thoughts and future</h2>
        <p class="paragraph container">
		   It was a fun, new experience and I'm glad I made the change. The next step is to use a CloudFront distribution so I can 
		   serve my files with https.
